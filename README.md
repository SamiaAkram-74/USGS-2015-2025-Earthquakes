I worked with the USGS Earthquakes dataset (1930–2025) from Kaggle and focused on the period 2015–2025, performing:
1-Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – handled missing values, formatted data, and prepared it for analysis.
2-Visualization – explored earthquake patterns, magnitudes, and distribution over time.
3-Prediction Models – applied multiple models including:
Prophet for time series forecasting
Random Forest for predictive analysis
KMeans Clustering to identify patterns and clusters
Linear Regression
I also created an Actual vs Predicted graph (2015–2025) to compare model predictions with real earthquake occurrences, giving clear insights into model performance.
Finally, I extended the analysis to forecast earthquakes from 2026 to 2030, leveraging historical data and predictive modeling.
